Links to methodtest.html and webcomponent.html can be found in the top right of my website's homepage. 
For Part 1 I tried to use XMLHttpRequest for the GET method then I used fetch() for the remaining methods.
Also, for the POST method there is a bug where upon loading into the page for the first time, if you enter
text into the fields and press the POST button the response will not include what you entered into the field.
After entering text into the fields you need to refresh and then press the POST button. The response will then 
feature the text you entered into fields. I hoped to have fixed this before the deadline but I no longer have 
the time to focus fixing this bug.
